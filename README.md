This is a compilation of different tools I have created to resolve various issues.

# CSVSplitter

This tool was created to solve a manual process of splitting a CSV file and uploading each to a database. 

The tool will split the file with the requested amount of lines per file (10k line file to 10 different 1k line files) and number them accordingly.

It is customizable to limit the file format selected, number of lines per file, and output path.


The script is designed to be used in the same file directory of the file that is to be split. It is recommended to only have the file you wish to split in the file as the script when running it.
